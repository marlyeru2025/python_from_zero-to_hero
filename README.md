# python_from_zero-to_hero
 Python Written Assignment
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with a set of Python exercises designed to practice core programming concepts such as lists, functions, loops, conditions, and user input.
The notebook includes 10 questions, each focusing on a different Python skill.These tasks demonstrate my understanding of core programming logic and data handling.
🎓 Learning Path

 Topics Covered
- Working with lists (add, remove, sort, modify)
- Writing and using functions
- Taking input from the user
- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- Loops (for & while)
- Simple games and logic (Number Guessing Game)
- Basic data analysis with lists
 
To complete these assignments, I have learned and applied the following skills:
 * User Interaction: Using input() to receive data and converting it into integers for calculations.
 * Data Structures: Working with Lists (adding, removing, and sorting elements).
 * Control Flow: Using if-else statements for decision-making and while/for loops for repeating tasks.
 * Functions: Writing reusable code blocks to perform specific operations (like modifying lists or processing text).
 * Built-in Methods: Utilizing Python’s built-in tools like .sort(), len(), max(), and min().

📂 Highlights
The project includes practical examples like:
 * A Shopping List manager.
 * A Grade Calculator for students.
 * Data Sorting programs (Ascending & Descending).
 * Temperature & Age classification logic.
